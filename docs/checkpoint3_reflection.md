# Checkpoint 2 Reflection

## What I Implemented
* I add the ability for the user to move to the next room in the map
* I add a door icon in the rooms

---

## Second Feature Integration
* Can add RiddleNPCs in other rooms that the player can now access

---

## What Challenges I faced
* It took a little bit to get the door to transport the player to the next room


---

## What I learned
* I learned about multiple room functionality

---

## Testing Results
* After going through many iterations and having to temporarily change some of the existing code, I got it too work
* I had to have the answer input logic inside the test function

---

## Questions for Next Checkpoint
* How do I get the map to redraw without scrolling down and printing another map?
* How do I add an award system to correctly answering riddles?
* How do I add functionality for the player to use key or for the game to unlock the ability to use doors

---

## Time Spent
* Upwards of 5 hours
