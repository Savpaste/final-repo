# Checkpoint 1 Reflection

## What I Implemented
* I added a room draw function that is called through the map class
* I added the ability to add the player and NPCs to the map, and the ability for the player to navigate

---

## What Challenges I faced
* The hardest part for me was actually doing the operating system things

---

## What I learned
* I learned a lot about navigating the terminal and what commands to use
* I learned how to set up and run automated CTest unit tests

---

## Testing Results
* After a few run throughs, the test worked.
* I just had to adjust the map draw assertion so there was no conflict when adding player and NPC

---

## Questions for Next Checkpoint
* How do I get the map to redraw without scrolling down and printing another map? 

---

## Time Spent
* Upwards of 7 hours. All of this stuff is very new to me so it takes a while to implement it
