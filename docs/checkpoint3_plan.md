# Checkpoint 3: Third Feature Plan

## Feature Name
* Room change feature

## Description
* This feature will make it possible to switch between rooms.

## Why This Feature?
* I chose this feature because it I have implemented most of the necessary features for a single room.

## Classes Involved
* The classes involved will be the Room class, the Map class, and the Palace class.

## Expected User Workflow
* When the user goes to the door they will be entered into the next room in sequence.

## Estimated Time
* I estimate this will take about 4 hours.
