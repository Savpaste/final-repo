# Checkpoint 2 Reflection

## What I Implemented
* I added a RiddleNPC class
* I added riddle logic and functionality
* I added the ability to add riddles to the RiddleNPC character

---

## First Feature Integration
* It integrates by adding the RiddleNPC to the current room draw and allowing interaction with the player character

---

## What Challenges I faced
* The hardest part for me was getting the test to work correctly
* It was also difficult to get the riddle logic to display correctly and without printing errors 

---

## What I learned
* I learned about solver functions 
* I learned about question and answer functionality

---

## Testing Results
* After a going through many iterations and having to temporarily change some of the existing code, I got it too work
* I had to have the answer input logic inside the test function

---

## Questions for Next Checkpoint
* How do I get the map to redraw without scrolling down and printing another map?
* How do I add an award system to correctly answering riddles?
* How do I add the change room functionality?

---

## Time Spent
* Upwards of 5 hours. A lot of the time was spent getting the test to work correctly
