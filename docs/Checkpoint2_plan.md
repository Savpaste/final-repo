# Checkpoint 2: Second Feature Plan

## Feature Name
* Riddle feature

## Description
* This feature will make it possible to add an NPC specifically to ask riddles. It will also include the riddle itself and the solver function for the riddle.

## Why This Feature?
* I chose this feature because it logically follows as a next step. Since I have the room/map and the player and regular NPCs, the next step is to begin adding the features for advancing in the game, and the riddle feature is the easiest to implement.

## Classes Involved
* The classes involved will be the Riddle class, and the RiddleNPC class. The actual riddle logic will be implemented in Palace.cpp.

## Expected User Workflow
* When the user runs into the RiddleNPC, it will trigger the riddle. The user will have to input the correct answer to advance or receive a reward.

## Estimated Time
* I estimate this will take about 4 hours.
