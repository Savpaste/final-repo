# Final Reflection

## Project Summary
* My project is a puzzle based game. The user must solve puzzles to unlock doors and advance to 
rooms until they win the game.
* I implemented a map with multiple rooms. A main character and NPCs, and a riddle function. The NPC asks 
the riddle and if the user gets the correct answer, they can advance.
* My project implements movement and interaction well.

## What Remains
* I was not able to implement the puzzle aspect of the game.
* I was not able to get the screen to clear and the map to reprint. It just prints another map and continues
to scroll down... However, it does work correctly if using the terminal app.
* I could add the puzzle aspect, but the project works as intended as is.

## Time Estimate
**For Each Remaining Item** 
* If I had to guess, the puzzle aspect would probably take another 6 hours to implement correctly. The logic itself
wouldn't be that hard, but figuring out what puzzles to employ and how to implement each one might take some time.
* The classes are in place. I would just need to add the correct functions and implement them.
* The only priority I have left is to add the puzzle aspect. It would be Nice-to-have, and it would probably take around
6 hours

## What I Learned
* Literally everything. This is my first experience with any type of computer programming. I also do not have a lot 
of experience with the technical side of computers in general. The bulk of this class was all brand new to me.
* The hardest part for me was probably understanding when and how to employ pointers.
* If I was starting over, I would make a more concise structure when I made my header files.
* I am most proud of the hard work and time I put in to learn the material and finish the class with an "A" and complete all the projects.
I am also proud of the project I made.
* My understanding of data structures has changed drastically... although I feel like I still have a long way to go until I feel
comfortable with coding on a consistent basis.

## Time Log (estimates)
* Planning and design: 4 hours
* Implementation: 10 hours
* Testing and debugging: 6 hours
* Documentation: 3 hours
* **Total**: 23 hours
